                                  two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef allows

                                  objects. * While dataSource ignores disallowed values
                                  (dropping them), dataSourceRef preserves all values,
                                  and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                  specified. * While dataSource only allows local
                                  objects, dataSourceRef allows objects in any namespaces.

                              (dropping them), dataSourceRef preserves all values,
                              and generates an error if a disallowed value is specified.
                              * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef
                              allows objects in any namespaces. (Beta) Using this

                                    and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same value
                                    automatically if one of them is empty and the
                                    other is non-empty. When namespace is specified
                                    in dataSourceRef, dataSource isn''t set to the
                                    same value and must be empty. There are three
                                    important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                    * While dataSource only allows two specific types
                                    of objects, dataSourceRef allows any non-core
                                    object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                    * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping
                                    them), dataSourceRef preserves all values, and
                                    generates an error if a disallowed value is specified.
                                    * While dataSource only allows local objects,
                                    dataSourceRef allows objects in any namespaces.

                                  and generates an error if a disallowed value is

                              must have the same value. For backwards compatibility,
                              when namespace isn''t specified in dataSourceRef, both
                              fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to

                              between dataSource and dataSourceRef: * While dataSource
                              only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                              allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim
                              objects. * While dataSource ignores disallowed values
                              (dropping them), dataSourceRef preserves all values,
                              and generates an error if a disallowed value is specified.
                              * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef
                              allows objects in any namespaces. (Beta) Using this

                        is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule. \n For
                        example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains
                        is set to 5 and pods with the same labelSelector spread as
                        2/2/2: | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 | |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  |
                        The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so \"global
                        minimum\" is treated as 0. In this situation, new pod with
                        the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled, because computed
                        skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the
                        three zones, it will violate MaxSkew. \n This is a beta field
                        and requires the MinDomainsInPodTopologySpread feature gate
                        to be enabled (enabled by default)."

                                    same value and must be empty. There are three
                                    important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                    * While dataSource only allows two specific types
                                    of objects, dataSourceRef allows any non-core
                                    object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                    * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping
                                    them), dataSourceRef preserves all values, and
                                    generates an error if a disallowed value is specified.
                                    * While dataSource only allows local objects,
                                    dataSourceRef allows objects in any namespaces.

                              allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim
                              objects. * While dataSource ignores disallowed values
                              (dropping them), dataSourceRef preserves all values,
                              and generates an error if a disallowed value is specified.
                              * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef
                              allows objects in any namespaces. (Beta) Using this

                        (default) tells the scheduler not to schedule it. - ScheduleAnyway
                        tells the scheduler to schedule the pod in any location, but
                        giving higher precedence to topologies that would help reduce
                        the skew. A constraint is considered "Unsatisfiable" for an
                        incoming pod if and only if every possible node assignment
                        for that pod would violate "MaxSkew" on some topology. For
                        example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods
                        with the same labelSelector spread as 3/1/1: | zone1 | zone2
                        | zone3 | | P P P |   P   |   P   | If WhenUnsatisfiable is
                        set to DoNotSchedule, incoming pod can only be scheduled to
                        zone2(zone3) to become 3/2/1(3/1/2) as ActualSkew(2-1) on
                        zone2(zone3) satisfies MaxSkew(1). In other words, the cluster
                        can still be imbalanced, but scheduler won''t make it *more*
                        imbalanced. It''s a required field.'

                            pod will *not* be used for the pod to avoid using an unrelated
                            volume by mistake. Starting the pod is then blocked until
                            the unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC
                            is meant to be used by the pod, the PVC has to updated
                            with an owner reference to the pod once the pod exists.
                            Normally this should not be necessary, but it may be useful
                            when manually reconstructing a broken cluster. \n This

                                    specified in dataSourceRef, both fields (dataSource
                                    and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same value

                                    other is non-empty. When namespace is specified
                                    in dataSourceRef, dataSource isn''t set to the
                                    same value and must be empty. There are three
                                    important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                    * While dataSource only allows two specific types
                                    of objects, dataSourceRef allows any non-core
                                    object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                    * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping
                                    them), dataSourceRef preserves all values, and
                                    generates an error if a disallowed value is specified.
                                    * While dataSource only allows local objects,
                                    dataSourceRef allows objects in any namespaces.

                                  non-empty API group (non core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim
                                  object. When this field is specified, volume binding
                                  will only succeed if the type of the specified object
                                  matches some installed volume populator or dynamic
                                  provisioner. This field will replace the functionality
                                  of the dataSource field and as such if both fields
                                  are non-empty, they must have the same value. For
                                  backwards compatibility, when namespace isn''t specified
                                  in dataSourceRef, both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef)
                                  will be set to the same value automatically if one
                                  of them is empty and the other is non-empty. When
                                  namespace is specified in dataSourceRef, dataSource
                                  isn''t set to the same value and must be empty.
                                  There are three important differences between dataSource
                                  and dataSourceRef: * While dataSource only allows
                                  two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef allows
                                  any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim
                                  objects. * While dataSource ignores disallowed values
                                  (dropping them), dataSourceRef preserves all values,
                                  and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                  specified. * While dataSource only allows local
                                  objects, dataSourceRef allows objects in any namespaces.

                              and generates an error if a disallowed value is specified.
                              * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef
                              allows objects in any namespaces. (Beta) Using this

                                    This field will replace the functionality of the
                                    dataSource field and as such if both fields are
                                    non-empty, they must have the same value. For
                                    backwards compatibility, when namespace isn''t
                                    specified in dataSourceRef, both fields (dataSource
                                    and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same value
                                    automatically if one of them is empty and the
                                    other is non-empty. When namespace is specified
                                    in dataSourceRef, dataSource isn''t set to the
                                    same value and must be empty. There are three
                                    important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                    * While dataSource only allows two specific types
                                    of objects, dataSourceRef allows any non-core
                                    object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                    * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping
                                    them), dataSourceRef preserves all values, and
                                    generates an error if a disallowed value is specified.
                                    * While dataSource only allows local objects,
                                    dataSourceRef allows objects in any namespaces.
